      <p> My name is Herendira Gomez, I am a proudly mexican mother of 5. I love spend time with them and I enjoy to play in our little band. </p>
      <p> I work in a Bank helping the system of Direct deposit and withdrawal.</p>
      <p> I like the phrase "one day at the time" like says the scripture in 2 Nephi 28:30, <i>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, 
          aprecept upon precept, here a little and there a little; </i> I would like to learn that said the scripture line by line, and I know God 
          can help to preparer our minds to keep and understand all the new information</p>
      <p> Something intersting about me, I work in French, I study in English and Spanish at home</p>
