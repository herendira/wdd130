            <h1>Atlantic Islands</h1>
            <p>
                The first part of North America to be discovered by Europeans, Canada’s four Atlantic provinces comprise a small group of 
                islands and peninsulas on Canada’s eastern coast. Though low in population and economically weak, they 
                possess a proud, centuries-old culture that combines a distinct mix of British, Scottish, Gaelic and F
                rench customs, creating a unique, tradition-oriented people. Almost everyone in Canada claims to find 
                Atlantic Canada quaint and interesting — even if few are exactly scrambling to live there.
                The Atlantic Immigration Program is a pathway to permanent residence for skilled 
                foreign workers and international graduates from a Canadian institution who want to work 
                and live in 1 of Canada’s 4 Atlantic provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island 
                or Newfoundland and Labrador. The program helps employers hire qualified candidates for jobs they 
                haven’t been able to fill locally.

              The Atlantic Immigration Program replaced the Atlantic Immigration Pilot. You can now 
              submit your permanent residence application to the program.
